Submission for Dicoding Front End Study (Complete)

This web contains features such as, an "Add Book", a Search feature, and two lists of Uncompleted and Completed Books.

The "Add Book" features contains 4 items, such as title, author, year, and isCompleted checkbox, as well as a button to add the book.

The Search feature finds all books that contains AT LEAST one of the Search items (title, author, year), so for example:
1. The title contains "A" will find all books with A in it.
2. If the author also contains a word, it will find all books that has the word "A" in the title as well as all books that contains the author's search word.

The two lists of Uncompleted and Completed Books are ordered by the order it's inputed into the storage.

The website uses website features such as Javascript and Local Storage to process books listing and managing.

This website was made possible thanks to Dicoding Indonesia.
